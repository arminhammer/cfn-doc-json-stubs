You can create up to 5 global                                 secondary indexes.ImportantIf you update a table to include a new global secondary index, AWS CloudFormation                                    initiates                                    the index creation and then proceeds with the stack update. AWS CloudFormation doesn't                                    wait for                                    the index to complete creation because the backfilling phase can take a long time,                                    depending on the size of the table. You can't use the index or update the table                                    until the index's status is ACTIVE. You can track its status by using                                    the DynamoDB DescribeTable command.If you add or delete an index during an update, we recommend that you don't                                    update any other resources. If your stack fails to update and is rolled back while                                    adding a new index, you must manually delete the index.If you update only the provisioned throughput values of global secondary                                          indexes, you can update the table without                                             interruption.You can delete or add one global secondary index without interruption. If you do both in the                                          same update (for example, by changing the index's logical ID), the update                                          fails.","Array":true,"Type":"aws-properties-dynamodb-gsi","Required":"No","UpdateRequires":"Updates are not supported.
