Each DB instance can have a limited number of read replicas. For more                                 information, see Working with Read                                    Replicas in the Amazon Relational Database Service Developer Guide.The SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property determines whether a DB                                 instance is a read replica. If you remove the                                 SourceDBInstanceIdentifier property from your template and then                                 update your stack, AWS CloudFormation deletes the read replica and creates a new DB                                 instance                                 (not a read replica).ImportantIf you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we                                             recommend that you specify the VPCSecurityGroups property.                                             If you don't specify the property, the read replica inherits the value of                                             the VPCSecurityGroups property from the source DB when you                                             create the replica.

This change might cause                                             unexpected issues.Read replicas do not support deletion policies.
